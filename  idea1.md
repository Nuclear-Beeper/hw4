Piercing the bubbles
Some small circles randomly emergy on the canvas, and they will grow bigger and bigger over time.
The player has to use their mouse to click the circles to make them disappear.
Whenever the circles are clicked, the player gain scores.
Once any of the circles bigger than a specific size, the player lose the game. So, the user has to click the circles before them getting too big.
The circles will appear more and more over time, so the difficulty increases over time.
The small circles will have a blue or green color, but the color will gradually change to red alone their size.
